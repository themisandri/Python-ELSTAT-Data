# A python project that processes data on tourism in Greece for years 2011-2015

The repo contains a python script that will download all the necessary
excel files from the ELSTAT website. It also includes a python program that processes the necessary data from
excel files and loads them in corresponding tables of a MySQL database. In the end the
specific data are exported to corresponding .csv files

The data and the graphs that are being drawn are about: 
- Total tourist arrivals in Greece for the years 2011-2015
- Countries of origin with the largest share of tourist arrivals in
Greece for the years 2011-2015
- Arrivals of tourists in Greece by means of transport for the years 2011-
2015
- Arrivals of tourists in Greece per quarter for the years 2011-2015
